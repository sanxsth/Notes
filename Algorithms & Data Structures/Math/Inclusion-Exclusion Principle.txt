Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

	In combinatorics, the inclusion-exclusion principle is a counting technique that generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the union of two finite sets.

	|A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B|

	|A U B| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A intersect B| - |A intersect C| - |B interect C| + |A intersect B intersect C|

	To find the cardinality of the union of n sets,

		1. Include the cardinalities of the sets.
		2. Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
		3. Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
		4. Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
		5. Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
		6. Continue, until the cardinality of the n-tuple-wise intersection is included (if n is odd) or excluded (n even).
