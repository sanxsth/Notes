Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

In computer science, cycle detection or cycle finding is the algorithmic problem of finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.

Let's see how we can use this algorithm to detect cycles in a linked list

	1. Traverse linked list using two pointers.
	2. Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
	3. If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then the linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.
