Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm

The Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm is an algorithm for finding the majority of a sequence of elements using linear time and constant space.

Problem Statement

	Given a non-sorted list of 'n' numbers, one of the numbers appears more than n/2 times. Find this number in O(n) time and O(1) space.

Algorithm

	candidate = 0
	count = 0
	for value in input:
	  if count == 0:
	    candidate = value
	  if candidate == value:
	    count += 1
	  else:
	    count -= 1

Proof can be found in the reference
