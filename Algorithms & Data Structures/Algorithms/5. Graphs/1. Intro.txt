Graphs

	A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and edges connect 'related' nodes.

	There are mainly two main graph representations:

		1. Adjacency Matrix
		2. Adjacency List

	Directed Graphs and Undirected Graphs

		A directed graph is a graph where the edges have a direction (they are uni-directional). In undirected graphs, the edges are bidirectional. 

	Handshaking lemma

		The handshaking lemma is the statement that every finite graph has an even number of vertices with an odd degree. The handshaking lemma is a consequence of the degree sum formula (also sometimes called the handshaking lemma):

			Summation of degrees of all nodes = 2 * E, where 'E' is the number of edges.

		It's easy to observe that for every edge we add to the graph, we increment the total degree count by 2.

	Tree

		A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. A collection of trees is known as a forest.

	Polytree

		A poly tree is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. A 'polyforest' is a collection of DAGs.
