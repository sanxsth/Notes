What are design fundamentals?

	How sys design inteviews actually work?

		sys design questions are made intentionally vague. For example, design uber, design youtube, etc. It's upto the inteviewee to ask questions, investigate and find clarity so that we can have a 45 minute long conversation.

		Algo solutions are objectively correct or incorrect, but sys design solutions are subjective. It's the intervee's job to confidently justify the solution, rationalize why you made certain choices.

	System design fundamentals can be classified into 4 categories:

		1. Foundational System design knowledge. Eg: client-server model, network protocols (how machines communicate)
		2. Key characteristics of systems. Eg: availability, throughput, latency, redundancy, consistency
		3. Actual components of the system, these are the tangible things that you can either have or implement in your systems. Eg: load-balancers, proxies, caches, etc. These are the key components that gives you the key characterstics.
		4. Actual tech. These are the real, existing product or services that you can use in your system to give you some characterstics. Eg: Zookeeper, Nginx, Redis, S3, etc.
