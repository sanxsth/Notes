Rate Limiting

	Rate limiting is of limiting the number of work (requests) that can be completed in some given amount of time.

	One benefit of rate limiting is to defend against DOS attacks. You can rate-limit at the user level, region, whole system, etc.

	Keeping rate-limiting information at the machine level might not be efficient in a distributed system that horizontally scales. In such scenarios, we may use of central Redis server to store this information.
