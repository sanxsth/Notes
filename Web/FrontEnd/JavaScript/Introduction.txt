Introduction

	JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the Java programming language.

	ECMAScript (ECMA-262) is a specification for a general-purpose scripting language. JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language that complies with this specification.
